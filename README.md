Chromosomes topological domains role in gene expression variability

In Drosophila, insulators are detected at chromatin accessible regions enriched for active histone marks. What's more, they are occupied by multiple architectural proteins including CP190, Beaf32 and CTCF among others. Also, there are Mes4 and NSD as well as HypB and Set2 which regulate the deposition of repressive histone marks. The mutant-type cells in our project are either mes4-depleted or HypB-depleted.

We have four large datafiles. The first one being "Genes with NSD" where we could find the variability of gene expression. Then, we had the "Spreading score" which provided us with information on regulatory elements. Next, we had the “Leaks score", where a score is associated with leaks and we mainly found TAD leaks here. The last datafile is the “Fold-Change”, containing the difference in expression between two groups.

Single-cell sequencing is a set of molecular biology techniques that allows the analysis of genetic information at the scale of a single cell using next-generation sequencing technologies. In comparison with traditional sequencing techniques, this technology makes it possible to study cellular differences with optimal resolution and permits to understand the particularity of a cell within its micro-environment. Here it revealed to us the heterogeneity in the cell population. Therefore we noticed the cells’ differences.
